This is a small example project with front-end and back-end. I believe it was done for an interview many years ago. Didn't get the job, but hey, I learned a few things along the way. 

# people-search
> A Vue.js project

# start server (do first)
Enter 'Backend Server', build, and run 'PeopleSearch.sln' using Visual Studio.
Ensure you're on the latest version of AspNetCore, and EntityFrameworkCore.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# run unit tests
npm run unit
